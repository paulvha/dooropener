# Door opener

## ===========================================================

A program to create a door-opener, based on UNO, to open a door with
a password and/or NFC card. The solution is using a keypad, MFRC522
and LCD (16 x 2). These are often used hardware components that can be
sourced from many places. The dooropener can be connected through a
relay or any other electronic circuit. That is outside the scope of the
project.
<br> A detailed description of the options and findings are in dooropener.odt

## Getting Started
There was someone on a forum looking for help to get a door-opener, based serial,
keypad and MRFC522 card. He had some code, which was not working, copy / pasted
together.  The project looked interesting me, also I had all the components,
except a door opener, and had couple of hours on my hand. I have extended
the code with more functions and this document is the write up of the small project.

<br>Please be aware that I have NOT written much of the code. It is coming from different sources
from Internet, developed by others. I do not know who or where the real sources are coming
from. Hence I do not claim copyright or apply a license.
This is grapwareâ€¦ for you to play around and enjoy.
